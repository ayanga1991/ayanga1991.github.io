			<p> I am 4th year Computer Science Ph.D student at the National University of Singapore advised by Professor Li-Shiuan Peh. Before joining NUS, I worked as  Research Engineer in SYNERGEN Technology Labs, a USA-based startup from 2016-2019.
			 I was graduated from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka with BSc. Eng. (Hons) specialized in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering in 2016.
			</p>
			<p>
			My research involves improving the privacy and security of wearable devices and also data collected from wearable devices. I am also interested on Wearable computing/sensing, wearable
energy harvesting and wearable power and latency optimization.
